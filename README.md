#Boxclip
A 2d platform engine using the love2d framework with a built in map editor.

#####Running the game/engine
Install [love2d](https://love2d.org/), and simply type
`love .` in the directory or you can run the script *make_dist.sh* to create a love executable which can be double-clicked or run with `love platform_engine.love` (saving maps isn't supported with this method yet)

#####Please note
There is no stable release yet, and end goals may change vastly. Currently the plans are to have a box collision based world with a map editor, 
and simple path-based enemies.

Requires love2d >= 0.10.1

Many things are not implemented yet.
