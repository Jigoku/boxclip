#Boxclip
a 2d game engine using the love2d framework

#####Running the game/engine
Install [love2d](https://love2d.org/), and simply type
`love .` or you can run the script *make_dist.sh* to create a love executable which can be double-clicked or run with `love platform_engine.love`

#####Please note
This is not even a pre-alpha, and end goals may change. Currently the plans are to have a box collision based world with a map editor, and simple static path-based enemies.

#####Current features
* moving platforms
* friction
* gravity
* pickup collection
* destroyable containers
* AABB collision (old vs new test)
* simple camera
* debug mode
* simple enemy

#####Editor
* remove entitys
* place entitys
* primitive copy/paste
* reposition entities

Many things are not implemented yet.
