#Boxclip
a 2d platform engine using the love2d framework

#####Running the game/engine
Install [love2d](https://love2d.org/), and simply type
`love .` in the directory or you can run the script *make_dist.sh* to create a love executable which can be double-clicked or run with `love platform_engine.love` (saving maps isn't supported with this method yet)

#####Please note
This is not even a pre-alpha, and end goals may change. Currently the plans are to have a box collision based world with a map editor, and simple path-based enemies.
Requires love2d >= 0.10.1
