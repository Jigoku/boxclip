A work in progress 2D platform engine using the love2d framework with it's own custom built-in map editor.

###Running the game/engine
Install [love2d](https://love2d.org/), and simply type
`love .` in the directory or you can run the script *make_dist.sh* to create a love executable which can be double-clicked or run with `love boxclip.love`

Requires love2d 0.10.1 or higher.
