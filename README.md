#Boxclip
a 2d platform engine using the love2d framework

#####Running the game/engine
Install [love2d](https://love2d.org/), and simply type
`love .` in the directory or you can run the script *make_dist.sh* to create a love executable which can be double-clicked or run with `love platform_engine.love` (saving maps isn't supported with this method yet)

#####Please note
This is not even a pre-alpha, and end goals may change. Currently the plans are to have a box collision based world with a map editor, and simple path-based enemies.

#####Current features
* moving platforms
* friction
* gravity
* pickup collection
* destroyable crates
* AABB collision (old vs new test)
* debug/console mode
* simple camera
* checkpoints
* map editor
* draw filtering
* enemies
* props
* springs
* powerups
* portals (spawn/goal etc)

#####Editor
* remove entitys
* drag/drop platforms
* entity browser
* primitive copy/paste
* reposition platforms
* save map
* theme palettes
* camera zoom
* minimap overlay

Many things are not implemented yet.
